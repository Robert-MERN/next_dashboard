                  “I hate outsourcing anything. I never trust anyone and always firmly believe that I can do everything myself. Well. I just learned a lesson. I'm starting my own small business and am constantly overloaded with work. My friend suggested I hand over my social media marketing to Dad Designs Web, who she uses. I thought that was stupid. I could just do it myself. I lost so much sleep and worked way more hours than I needed to until I finally gave in and agreed to try them out. Absolutely no regrets! I can't believe I ever lived without them. Their team is quick, efficient, and so easy to work with. I would never trust anyone else but them to handle my social media.”

I had a complex, multi-page storefront that I needed built and they were able to deliver above and beyond what I thought was possible for the pricing. Since they built my site I asked if they could also do a logo redesign for me as well. The team worked with me to make sure I got exactly what I wanted.”

They made sure they fully understood exactly what I wanted for my site and even made suggestions I hadn't thought of to make it better. Multiple progress check ins to make sure everything was what I wanted. The end result was a beautiful site that showcased my product and its offerings better than I could have imagined.”

The team I was working with had already taken the effort to fully understand my brand and value prop, and communicated it well, so why wouldn't I want to continue working with them?”
