Dad Designs Web Service is an online service where individuals or entities that have signed up with Dad Designs Web as clients (each, a "Client") can post specific assignments and project descriptions, including illustrative samples or other media (each, a "Creative Brief"), revise those Creative Briefs (each, a "Revision Brief") and obtain responses (each, a "Response") to those Creative or Revision Briefs from design experts retained by Dad Designs Web ("Members"). Dad Designs Web will provide you, as the Client, the Service according to the Package you have chosen as detailed in section 1(e) below. Your Responses will be created iteratively through a drafting cycle of Creative Briefs, Revision Briefs and Responses, ultimately resulting in a final Response conforming to your various Creative and Revision Briefs.'
}, {
    title: "",
    text: '(b) Creative Brief and Responses. You are solely responsible for preparing and posting detailed descriptions of each of your Creative Briefs to the Website, including providing samples illustrating your Creative Brief and any relevant deadlines. For each Response to a Creative Brief that you want to receive, a term sheet (a "Term Sheet") will be generated that will contain, and be subject to, the terms and conditions you have established for the Creative or Revision Brief. Dad Designs Web is under no obligation to review a Creative or Revision Brief or Term Sheet for any purpose, including accuracy, completeness of information, quality or clarity. Dad Designs Web may decide, in its sole discretion, to deny a Creative or Revision Brief or a Term Sheet.'

If you fail to promptly inform Dad Designs Web that the Response is not reasonably responsive to the related Term Sheet or Creative Brief, you will be deemed to have accepted the Response. If you notify Dad Designs Web that you think a Response is not reasonably responsive to the related Creative Brief, you shall then submit to the Website a Revision Brief containing information regarding amendments or modification to be made to the initial Response. After you provide Dad Designs Web with a Revision Brief, Dad Designs Web will provide you with a subsequent Response that conforms to the additional criteria you requested. Dad Designs Web is not responsible for the content of Responses developed to the extent that such Responses are prepared to conform to your Creative or Revision Briefs."

    title: "",
    text: "(d) Revision Cycles. Revision cycles generally consist of unlimited additional compositions that incorporate changes you request in a Revision Brief. The purpose of the revision process is to create Responses that move your project forward in the specific direction you have determined. You may request significant changes in the first and second cycles, and the Responses generated might be quite different in nature from the original composition you selected. By the third revision request, your requests shall be modifications of the current composition only. Revision requests that depart from the then-current composition will be honored and completed in a timely manner, however; Dad Designs Web reserves the right to charge the client for each such Revision. No revision work, which requires payment, will be started without your authorization."
